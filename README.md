# Engage-CLI
A python script to use the Engage school management portal though the terminal.. because why not :)

## Notes
This only works for student and parent accounts. And I don't know if this works on all schools, but it dose work on my school. There are 2 versons of Engage CLI available :
* Full version : includes a nice (and buggy) TUI interface and is NOT recomended for use.
* Slim version : Doesn't have a TUI interface. More stable.

## Installation Instructions
* Install Python (just go search on how to install Python).
* Clone this Github reposiory with `git clone https://github.com/SaksornSea/Engage-CLI.git`.
* Run the `setup.py` script (and answer a few questions) to setup the config file and install the libraries required to run Engage CLI. Run with `python setup.py` or `python3 setup.py`
* And your all set!
